# College of Computer Study Student Council and Organization Online Membership Payment System

## Introduction

At Gordon College, the College of Computer Study (CCS) plays a vital role in shaping future IT professionals by offering programs such as Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT), Bachelor of Science in Entertainment and Multimedia Computing (BSEMC), and Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS). Alongside academic excellence, student councils and organizations such as ELITES, SPECS, and IMAGES provide platforms for leadership, creativity, and collaboration.

However, one challenge faced by these organizations is the traditional manual collection of membership fees, which often results in inefficiencies like delayed payments, inaccurate records, and difficulties in maintaining transparency. These issues not only hinder financial management but also consume valuable time that could otherwise be used for student-focused activities.

To address these challenges, the **College of Computer Study Student Council and Organization Online Membership Payment System** is introduced as a digital solution tailored for CCS students and organizations. This system provides a secure and user-friendly platform where students from BSIT, BSEMC, and BSCS programs can conveniently pay their membership dues online. At the same time, it assists councils and organizations such as ELITES, SPECS, and IMAGES by automating record-keeping, enabling real-time tracking of transactions, and generating financial reports with ease.

By minimizing manual errors and reducing administrative workload, the system fosters efficiency, transparency, and accountability in financial management across CCS organizations. Beyond efficiency, the system highlights Gordon College's commitment to innovation and digital transformation. By integrating technology into organizational operations, the project ensures that CCS student services remain future-ready, sustainable, and accessible.

Ultimately, the system benefits not only the leaders of ELITES, SPECS, and IMAGES but also the entire student body of BSIT, BSEMC, and BSCS, as it builds trust, enhances convenience, and allows organizations to focus more on delivering meaningful programs and activities that enrich student life within the College of Computer Study.

## Literature Review

The shift toward digital and cashless payment systems has transformed how organizations manage financial transactions. In the educational sector, e-payment platforms have been shown to reduce manual workload, improve transparency, and provide students with more convenient options.

### Key Research Findings

**Student Demand for Digital Payments**
- Discover Global Network research shows that 90% of college students express interest in using mobile payments for campus services, demonstrating the rising demand for streamlined financial systems in today's digital era.

**Adoption Patterns in Educational Settings**
- A 2023 study of university students in Ghaziabad, India, explores adoption patterns of digital payment apps. It reveals that convenience, time-saving, and the cashless nature of payments are key drivers, while trust, technical issues, and risk perceptions remain barriers.

**Factors Influencing E-Payment Adoption**
- Research involving students from several universities in the UAE found that trust and perceived ease of use significantly influence the intention to use e-payment systems, while perceived usefulness was surprisingly not a significant factor.

**Role of Trust in Digital Payments**
- A study among postgraduate students in Indonesia (2022) determined that perceived trust is a primary driver of continued e-wallet usage, acting also as a mediator for perceived security.

These findings support the need for a secure, convenient, and trustworthy online payment system for CCS organizations, addressing both the technological and psychological factors that influence student adoption of digital financial platforms.

## Statement of the Problem

The manual collection of membership fees in the College of Computer Study (CCS) organizations—specifically ELITES, SPECS, and IMAGES—continues to create challenges in terms of efficiency, convenience, and transparency. Students are required to physically pay their dues, which often results in long queues, delays, and inconvenience. At the same time, organization officers and treasurers face difficulties in handling cash, maintaining accurate records, and ensuring accountability in financial management.

These issues not only increase the risk of human error and inefficiency but also limit the organizations' ability to devote more time and resources to student-centered programs and activities.

### Main Problem

**How can an online membership payment system improve the efficiency, accuracy, and transparency of membership fee collection for CCS student organizations, specifically ELITES, SPECS, and IMAGES?**

### Specific Problems

1. How can the system eliminate the need for manual cash handling in ELITES, SPECS, and IMAGES to minimize risks and human errors in financial management?

2. How can the system reduce waiting times by eliminating physical queuing during membership fee collection across CCS organizations?

3. How can the system provide a more convenient and accessible payment process for members of ELITES, SPECS, and IMAGES through digital transactions?

4. How can the system enhance user experience by integrating features such as transaction history and dashboards for both students and organization officers?
